             <h3 class="subtitle">Student Ambassador in Taiwan Region</h3>
            <p>InvestIN Education | 09.2023 - Present</p>
            <p>Due to my profound enjoyment of the InvestIN Medical Camp experience, I was inspired to take on a more active role in promoting awareness of the program in Taiwan. Recognizing the limited familiarity in Taiwan, I went a step further and created an introductory video, hoping to inform more Taiwanese about the opportunities offered by InvestIN.</p>
             <h3 class="subtitle">Intern, Physician Shadowing</h3>
            <p>Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital  | 02.2023 - 03.2023</p>
            <p>Through this activity, I observed how doctors consulted patients, formulated treatment plans, resolved conflicts, and communicated with patients and other colleagues realistically. I also wrote a report on this experience. It also gives me an understanding of the life of a doctor as well as how the hospital operates.<p>
             <h3 class="subtitle">Elderly Caring</h3>
            <p>Taiyang Long-term Care Corporation | 02.2023 - Present</p>
            <p>Taiyang Long-term Care Corporation, a private long-term residential care, provides person-centered, empowering, and rehabilitative care services. It uses both additive and subtractive services, hoping the residents can return to their families.<p>
            <p>In this volunteer activity, I was responsible for accompanying the elderly, helping them eat, reading newspapers, and doing other service projects. The specific things I do are to draw postcards with them, take them out for a walk, and do some simple crafts to accompany them. Moreover, I had the opportunity to communicate with the elders.<p>
